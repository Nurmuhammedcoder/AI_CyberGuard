Abstract
This study presents AI CyberGuard, a novel ensemble approach combining Random Forest and Neural Networks for real-time cybersecurity threat detection. Our system achieves 97.2% accuracy with sub-2ms latency on network intrusion detection tasks.

1. Introduction and Problem Statement
1.1 Background
Network-based cyber attacks have increased by 300% since 2020, with traditional signature-based detection systems failing to identify zero-day threats. Current solutions suffer from:

High false positive rates (15-25%)
Inability to detect novel attack patterns
Computational inefficiency for real-time processing
1.2 Research Questions
Can ensemble methods improve detection accuracy beyond single-model approaches?
What is the optimal balance between model complexity and inference speed?
How does model interpretability affect security analyst decision-making?
1.3 Hypothesis
H1: Ensemble of Random Forest and Neural Networks will achieve >97% accuracy
H2: Real-time processing (<5ms latency) is feasible with optimized architecture
H3: Explainable AI features will improve threat analysis efficiency by 30%
