## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip package manager
- 4GB+ RAM recommended

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nurmuhammedcoder/AI_CyberGuard.git
cd AI_CyberGuard
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv my_cyber_env

# Windows
my_cyber_env\Scripts\activate

# Linux/macOS
source my_cyber_env/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Open browser to `http://localhost:8501`

### Training Models
```bash
cd src
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Generate synthetic training data
- Train both Random Forest and Neural Network models
- Create visualizations
- Save models to `models/` directory
- Generate performance reports

### Dashboard Features

- **Home** - System overview and status
- **Train Models** - Interactive model training interface
- **Detect Attacks** - Real-time threat analysis
- **Dashboard** - Performance metrics and visualizations

## 📈 Model Details

### Random Forest Classifier

- 200 decision trees
- Balanced class weights
- Max depth: 15
- Training time: ~2.4 seconds

### Neural Network

- Architecture: 128→64→32→16→1 neurons
- Activation: ReLU + Sigmoid output
- Optimizer: Adam (lr=0.001)
- Regularization: Dropout + BatchNormalization
- Training time: ~19 seconds

## 🎓 Educational Purpose

This project is designed for learning and demonstration purposes. It uses synthetic data to simulate network traffic patterns and attack behaviors.

### Current Limitations

- **Synthetic Data**: Uses generated data, not real network captures
- **Simplified Features**: 30 numerical features vs. complex real-world scenarios
- **Binary Classification**: Normal vs. Attack (real systems need multi-class)
- **No Real-time Processing**: Batch processing only
- **Educational Scope**: Not production-ready

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Completed)
- ✅ Basic ML models implementation
- ✅ Streamlit dashboard
- ✅ Model training pipeline
